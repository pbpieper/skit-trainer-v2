  read: { name: 'Elaborative Encoding', researcher: 'Craik & Lockhart, 1972',
    what: 'Processing information at a deeper level (meaning, emotion, context) creates stronger memory traces than shallow processing (just reading words).',
    how: "Don't just read — engage with the emotion, the humor, the stage directions. Ask yourself WHY the character says each line. The deeper you process, the stronger the memory.",
    when: 'Start here. First 1-2 passes through the material. Return whenever you need to re-anchor meaning.' },
  fill: { name: 'Cloze Deletion / Retrieval Practice', researcher: 'Pimsleur, 1967 / Roediger & Karpicke, 2006',
    what: 'Actively retrieving information from memory strengthens the memory trace far more than re-reading. Cloze deletion (filling blanks) forces retrieval at the word level.',
    how: 'Start at 20-30% blanks. As you improve, increase to 60-80%, then push to 100% for full recall practice. The struggle of trying to recall IS the learning.',
    when: 'After 2-3 read-throughs. This is your main workhorse for word-perfect memorization.' },
  firstletter: { name: 'Retrieval Cue Theory', researcher: 'Tulving & Pearlstone, 1966',
    what: 'Memory works through associations. A single cue (like a first letter) can trigger recall of the entire word or phrase. First-letter cues bridge the gap between full text and pure recall.',
    how: "Read through with first letters only. Say each word aloud as you decode it. When you get stuck, that's a weak link — focus extra attention there.",
    when: "After you're ~70% comfortable with the text. Great for identifying specific weak spots." },
  chunk: { name: 'Scaffolded Learning / Chunking', researcher: 'Vygotsky, 1978 / Miller, 1956',
    what: 'Working memory holds ~7 items. By grouping information into meaningful chunks and mastering each before combining, you work within cognitive limits while building toward the whole.',
    how: "Master each chunk until you can recite it without looking. Use sub-chunks (3a, 3b, 3c) to break down long passages before building back up to the full chunk.",
    when: 'Core learning phase. After initial read-through, this is where real memorization happens.' },
  flashcard: { name: 'Leitner Spaced Repetition', researcher: 'Sebastian Leitner, 1972',
    what: 'Cards you know well get tested less frequently; cards you struggle with get repeated immediately. This optimizes study time by focusing effort where it\'s needed most.',
    how: "Be honest with self-grading. Wrong cards come back the same round. The system automatically focuses your energy on weak spots.",
    when: 'After initial chunk learning. Great for consolidation and identifying which chunks need more work.' },
  cue: { name: 'Context-Dependent Memory', researcher: 'Godden & Baddeley, 1975',
    what: 'Memory retrieval is stronger when the retrieval context matches the encoding context. Practicing with cue lines simulates the actual performance context.',
    how: "Listen to/read the cue line, then deliver yours from memory. Focus on the transition — the cue should trigger your line automatically.",
    when: 'Performance preparation phase. After you know the words, train the transitions.' },
  rsvp: { name: 'Rapid Serial Visual Presentation', researcher: 'Forster, 1970',
    what: 'Presenting words one at a time at the Optimal Recognition Point eliminates eye movement, increasing reading speed and forcing sequential processing that mirrors speech patterns.',
    how: 'Start at 150-200 WPM for encoding. Increase speed as familiarity grows. The text-below view lets you see context. Multiple passes at increasing speeds builds fluency.',
    when: 'Supplementary tool throughout. Low speed for encoding, high speed for fluency.' },
  chain: { name: 'Serial Position & Chaining', researcher: 'Ebbinghaus, 1885',
    what: 'Items at the beginning (primacy) and end (recency) of a list are remembered best. The middle is weakest. Chaining progressively builds connections across the weak middle sections.',
    how: 'Start with chunks 1-2, then 1-3, then 1-4, etc. Each time you add a chunk, run the entire chain. This strengthens the transitions between chunks.',
    when: 'After mastering individual chunks. This bridges the gap between knowing parts and performing the whole.' },
  recall: { name: 'Free Recall / Testing Effect', researcher: 'Roediger & Karpicke, 2006',
    what: "Testing yourself (even unsuccessfully) produces better long-term retention than additional study time. The 3-tier grading (missed/close/nailed) gives you diagnostic information.",
    how: "See the chunk name and anchor. Try to recite the entire chunk aloud. Be honest in grading — 'close' means you got the gist but missed specific words.",
    when: 'Assessment checkpoints. Use between study sessions to measure progress and identify weak spots.' },
  loci: { name: 'Method of Loci (Memory Palace)', researcher: 'Simonides of Ceos, ~500 BC',
    what: 'Spatial memory is one of the strongest memory systems. By associating each piece of information with a vivid location in a familiar space, you leverage this powerful system.',
    how: "Walk through each 'stop' slowly. Spend 20-30 seconds vividly imagining the scene. Make it absurd, emotional, multi-sensory. The more vivid, the stronger the link.",
    when: "Early learning phase for structure. Return to it when you lose your place — the spatial sequence helps you find where you are." },
  perform: { name: 'Transfer-Appropriate Processing', researcher: 'Morris, Bransford & Franks, 1977',
    what: 'Memory is best when practice conditions match performance conditions. Performing the full skit with timing, emotion, and physicality is the closest match to the real thing.',
    how: 'Stand up. Use gestures. Time yourself. The physical and emotional engagement creates additional memory pathways beyond the verbal.',
    when: 'Final preparation. After all other methods have built the foundation, perform repeatedly to lock it in.' },
